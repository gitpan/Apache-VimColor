Apache::VimColor - Apache mod_perl Handler for syntax highlighting in HTML.

DESCRIPTION

  This apache handler converts text files in syntax highlighted HTML output
  using Text::VimColor. If allowed by the configuration the visitor can also
  download the text-file without syntax highlighting.

  Since Text::VimColor isn't the fastest module this version can use
  Cache::Cache to cache the parsed files. Also the ETag and LastModified HTTP
  headers are set to help browsers and proxy servers to cache the URL.

REQUIREMENTS

  * perl 5.6.0 or later
  * Apache2          <http://httpd.apache.org/>
  * mod_perl2        <http://perl.apache.org/>
  * vim              <http://www.vim.org/>
  * Text::VimColor   <http://cpan.org/modules/by-module/Text/>

  Optional but recommended:
  * Cache::Cache     <http://cpan.org/modules/by-module/Cache/>

INSTALL

  Same procedure as every year, James!

  To install, first make sure all of the above requirements are met. Then cd to
  the directory that contains this README file and type the following:

    perl Makefile.PL

  If you wish to install this bundle somewhere other than the default location
  then type something like:

    perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/me/perl

  Then to build run make

    make

  If you have write access to the install directory (or the one specified by
  PREFIX) then you can now type:

    make install

  Assuming that the install target is in your PERL5LIB path then you are now
  ready to use Apache::VimColor. Configurate your Apache as described in the
  man page.  Enjoy!
