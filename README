INSTALL

  Same procedure as every year, James!

  To install, first make sure all of the above requirements are met. Then cd to
  the directory that contains this README file and type the following:

    perl Makefile.PL

  If you wish to install this bundle somewhere other than the default location
  then type something like:

    perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/me/perl

  Then to build run make

    make

  If you have write access to the install directory (or the one specified by
  PREFIX) then you can now type:

    make install

  Assuming that the install target is in your PERL5LIB path then you are now
  ready to use Apache::VimColor. Configurate your Apache as it described in the
  man page.  Enjoy!
