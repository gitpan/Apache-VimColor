Apache::VimColor - Apache mod_perl PerlHandler for syntax highlighting
various file types.

To install, first install mod_perl (see http://perl.apache.org).
Then cd to the directory that contains this README file and type the
following:

    perl Makefile.PL

If you wish to install this bundle somewhere other than the default
location then type something like:

    perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/me/perl

Then to build run make

    make

If you have write access to the install directory (or the one specified by
PREFIX) then you can now type:

    make install

Presuming that the install target is in your PERL5LIB path then you are
now ready to use Apache::VimColor. Configurate your apache as it described
in the man page. 
Enjoy!
