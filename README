INSTALL

Same procedure as every year, James!

To install, first make sure all of the above requirements are met. Then cd to
the directory that contains this README file and type the following:

    perl Makefile.PL

If you wish to install this bundle somewhere other than the default
location then type something like:

    perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/me/perl

Then to build run make

    make

If you have write access to the install directory (or the one specified by
PREFIX) then you can now type:

    make install

Presuming that the install target is in your PERL5LIB path then you are
now ready to use Apache::VimColor. Configurate your Apache as it described
in the man page.
Enjoy!
