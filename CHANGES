- Minor fixes to the included stylesheet.

Version 2.30, Jun 04 2005, Florian Forster <octo@verplant.org>
- The possibility to display line numbers has been added due to popular
  request ;)

Version 2.20, Mar 25 2005, Florian Forster <octo@verplant.org>
- Send E-Tag and Last-Modified HTTP-header fields so caching of generated
  output in HTTP-caches (i.e. proxies) is possible.

Version 2.10, Mar 16 2005, Florian Forster <octo@verplant.org>
- Cache::Cache is now being used as requested (RT#11883). Apache::VimColor is
  still installable without Cache::Cache, but caching won't work without it.
- The output has been changed a bit.

Version 2.00, Mar 15 2005, Florian Forster <octo@verplant.org>
- Implemented caching as requested (RT#11883)
- Fixed behavior when (trying to) access non-existent files or file which are
  unreadable (sending an ``File not found'' or ``Forbidden'' as needed..)

- Initial release
